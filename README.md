# Personal Project: Financial Analysis Tool

This is a personal project I am creating to assist my learning and implement skills I have gained throughout work and school. I have always been interested in finance and have been actively investing and trading since I turned 18, which is why I chose to create this project.

## Goals
- [x] Create a basic stock analysis tool that can pull live stock data as well as historical data.
- [x] Pull basic company fundamental data and do basic analysis
- [x] Implement more advanced, custom analysis.
- [x] Expand to analyze cryptocurrency, options, and other derivatives.
- Train and implement Neural Net to perform analysis.

I plan to start simple and add each feature as I learn more about the space. Feel free to follow along or play with the project if you find it interesting or useful!
